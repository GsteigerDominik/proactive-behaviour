{reasoning}

Your task is to write a short message, like one you'd naturally send in a casual chat. This message should:
- Feel human, warm, and natural — like a supportive friend.
- Be directly based on the most recent user message and overall chat context.
- Acknowledge what the user said, did, or is about to do — avoid repeating generic reminders.
- Be no more than 1–2 sentences.
- Avoid robotic phrasing — sound spontaneous and personal.
- Be engaging only if the situation calls for it — otherwise, just be responsive and present.
